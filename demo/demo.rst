DEMO
====

This folder contains two files for a demo test of the pair-guides script. The NM_005308_results.txt file contains the ChopChop results for the grk5 gene. The gene_block_settings.inp file contains the minimal settings required to generate guide pairs.

To run pair-guides on the demo files, navigate to the demo directory and invoke the "pair-guides" command in the terminal.

Try adjusting the settings away from their default values to see the results. Be careful: running the script multiple times in the same directory can overwrite the results files if the script is invoked multiple times without renaming the old outputs or changing the output target in the settings input file.
