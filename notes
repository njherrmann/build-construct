** TOP LEVEL **

- Find a way to make the program minimally terminal-dependent
  - Is there a way to open the terminal for a direc from that finder window?
- Get Beautiful Soup (or BS4) on macs in the Chen lab
- Omit GuidePairs if the sequences overlap



** [TargetSequence] **

- Does a TargetSequence with the first character or two have the same offtargets?


** [GuideBuilder] **

- Add some machinery to parse and store settings in a dict on the instance level.
- Right now, the sort method only sorts sequences by gen_loc. (and does it by default) Do we need another sorting metric?


** [build.py] **

structure:

  settings = sr.SettingsReader('settings.inp')

  loader = ccds.CcdsLoader()
  loader.load(settings) # contains CCDS ID

  builder = gb.GuideBuilder(settings.settings)
  builder.set_exon_edges(loader.get_exon_edges())
  builder.build_pairs() # assembles gene pairs

  output(builder.get_pairs()) # reports pairs
