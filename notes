** TOP LEVEL **

- Find a way to make the program minimally terminal-dependent
  - Is there a way to open the terminal for a direc from that finder window?
- Get Beautiful Soup (or BS4) on macs in the Chen lab



** [settings.inp] **
- results_file     (REQUIRED)
- CCDS_ID          (REQUIRED)
- output_file      (CCDS_ID_pairs.out)
- max_offtargets   (0,0,0,0)
- gRNA2_start_G    (True)
- separation_limit (< 10kbp)
- latest_gRNA1     (0.5)
(- something to limit where in the gene the pairs appear?)


** [TargetSequence] **

- Does a TargetSequence with the first character or two have the same offtargets?


** [GuideBuilder] **

- Add some machinery to parse and store settings in a dict on the instance level.
- Right now, the sort method only sorts sequences by gen_loc. (and does it by default) Do we need another sorting metric?


** [build.py] **

structure:

  settings = sr.SettingsReader('settings.inp')

  loader = ccds.CcdsLoader()
  loader.load(settings) # contains CCDS ID

  builder = gb.GuideBuilder()
  builder.read(settings) # reads results file
  builder.build_pairs() # assembles gene pairs

  output(builder.get_pairs()) # reports pairs
