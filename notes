** TOP LEVEL **

- Find a way to make the program minimally terminal-dependent
  - Is there a way to open the terminal for a direc from that finder window?
- Get Beautiful Soup (or BS4) on macs in the Chen lab



** [TargetSequence] **

- Does a TargetSequence with the first character or two have the same offsites?


** [GuideBuilder] **

- Right now, the sort method only sorts sequences by gen_loc. (and does it by default) Do we need another sorting metric?
- REWORK set_start_guides()
    while compiling each start guide candidate,
    also build out the list of GuidePairs.



GIT UPDATE NOTES
- renamed GeneParser to GuideBuilder
